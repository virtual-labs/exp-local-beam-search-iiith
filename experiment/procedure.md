### **Adjust Parameters and Grid Size**
- In the practice section, use the **Control Menu** to modify grid size (Default is 8). Click **"Start"** to start.
  - **Starting States:** The starting state is randomly generated.

### **Heuristic Value Representation**
- The grid displays the **Heuristic Value** for each state. Each cell represents the heuristic value if the queen in the same column as the cell is placed in that cell.

### **Progressing Through Iterations**
- Click **"Next"** to calculate the Best Heuristic Value for the next state in the current iteration. Click **"Next"** again to move to the next state.
  - When a terminal state is reached, the simulation stops and can be reset to start again by clicking **"Reset"**.

### **Answering Questions**
- Start hill climbing algorithm and type the answer in the observation tab when it stops. It will automatically proceed if the answer is correct.
