# Beam Search

## Introduction to Local Beam Search
The local beam search algorithm keeps track of **k states** rather than just one like in Hill Climbing. It begins with **k randomly generated states**. At each step, all the successors of all k states are generated. If any one is a goal, the algorithm halts. Otherwise, it selects the k best successors from the complete list and repeats.
In beam search, useful information is passed among the parallel search threads, and the algorithm starts looking at states where there is a higher chance of reaching the goal state.
The main algorithm is similar to Hill Climbing, but now the successors are generated for k states and the best k successors are chosen to continue the search.

### N Queens Example

* The goal of the 8-queens problem is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no queen attacks any other. (A queen attacks any piece in the same row, column or diagonal.) 
* An incremental formulation involves operators that augment the state description, starting with an empty state; for the 8-queens problem, this means that each action adds a queen to the state. A complete-state formulation starts with all 8 queens on the board and moves them around.
* This experiment uses a complete-state formulation, where each state has 8 queens on the board, one per column. The successors of a state are all possible states generated by moving a single queen to another square in the same column (so each state has 8 × 7 = 56 successors). 

### The Heuristic Function
* The heuristic cost function h is the number of pairs of queens that are attacking each other, either directly or indirectly.
* The aim of the algorithm is to minimize the heuristic cost function h, which is 0 when the state is a solution to the problem.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization:** Start with k random states.
2. **Successor Generation:** Generate all possible successor states by moving a single queen to another square in the same column for all k states.
3. **Selection:** Choose the best k successor states with the lowest heuristic costs.
4. **Termination:** If one of the selected states is the goal state (h = 0), terminate the algorithm; otherwise, repeat steps 2-3.

**Tie Breaking**: Beam Search algorithms typically choose randomly among the set of best successors if there is more than one.


### Disadvantages
Local beam search can suffer from a lack of diversity among the k states—they can quickly become concentrated in a small region of the state space, making the search little more than an expensive version of hill climbing.

### Beam Search Variants
1. **Stochastic Beam Search**: Instead of choosing the best k from the the pool of candidate successors, stochastic beam search chooses k successors at random, with the probability of choosing a given successor being an increasing function of its value.
